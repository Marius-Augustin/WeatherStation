## IoT Weather Station - Marius-Augustin Ni≈£u

The project is a weather monitoring system built using a Raspberry Pi and programmed in Python. It utilizes a AHT10 and MPL3115A2 sensor, communicating over the I2C protocol, to acquire temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data. The collected data is sent to the IoT platform ThingSpeak using HTTP requests. On the ThingSpeak platform, the data is stored, analyzed, and visualized through real-time graphs and charts.
